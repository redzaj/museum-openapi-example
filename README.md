## Getting started

An imaginary, but delightful Museum API for interacting with museum services and information.

### Example of usage

1. Open the [Operations](/openapi/museum-api/openapi/operations/) section to retrieve museum working hours.
2. Then you can navigate to the [Events](/openapi/museum-api/openapi/events/) section to view all available events.
3. Finally, you can proceed to the [Tickets](/openapi/museum-api/openapi/tickets/) section to purchase a ticket for visiting the museum or attending a specific event.
